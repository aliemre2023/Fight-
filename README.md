# Turn-Based-Strategy-Game

That's a traditional game.

Firstly, you have three choices (play, adding character, quit);

Careful! If you want to play, after you enter "1", you should choose characters with their indexes, not with their name.
(e.g. if you want to choose "Pveyla", you should enter "0".)

Adding Character is not so hard after you enter "2", you give "name", "atk", "hp" and "def". 
Your new character will be permanently saved in the excel file.

And if you want to close the program, you should press "3" when you are in the main page.

I hope i coded clearly.
